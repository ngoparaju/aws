Cloud Computing:
================

Agility :
	-	"Agility" refers to the ability to rapidly develop, test and launch software applications that drive business growth 
	-	you can instantly deploy new applications. This ability is called Agility.
	
Scalability :
	-	Scalability is used to meet the static increase in the workload.
	-	Scalability is always used to address the increase in workload in an organization.
	-	Scalability is used by giant companies whose customer circle persistently grows in order to do the operations efficiently.
	-	Scalability is a long term planning and adopted just to deal with an expected increase in demand.

Elasticity :
	-	Elasticity is used just to meet the sudden up and down in the workload for a small period of time.
	-	Elasticity is used to meet dynamic changes, where the resources need can increase or decrease.
	-	Elasticity is commonly used by small companies whose workload and demand increases only for a specific period of time.
	-	It is a short term planning and adopted just to deal with an unexpected increase in demand or seasonal demands.
	
Reliability :
	-	the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, by dynamically acquiring computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions.
	
Advantages that AWS Cloud offers over a traditional on-premises IT infrastructure :

	-	Trade capital expenses for variable expenses
	-	Eliminate gussing on your infrastructure capacity needs
	-	Benefit from massive economies of scale
	-	Increase speed and agility
	-	Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers 
	-	Go global in minutes
	

Scale up and Down :

	-	A scale up operation implies you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to your existing machine/node 
	-	A scale up operation runs on a single instance. Adding power is only possible through the addition of resources in the form of CPU, RAM, or storage to enhance performance.
	-	Fault tolerance is not possible for such scaling operations since a single instance is prone to failure.
	

Scale in and out :

	-	A scale out operation implies you scale by adding more instances to your existing pool of resources
	-	Scale out systems are oftentimes able to outperform scale up systems by enabling parallel execution of workloads and distributing those across many different computers.
	-	Fault tolerance is achieved by a scale out operation
